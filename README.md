# metaLauncher
This is the launcher launcher.  It is the meat that actually runs the Unity launcher and any chosen apps.


1) Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

2) Make sure python is added to your environment variables

3) Change unityLauncherPath.txt to contain the absolute path to the Unity Launcher

4) Set the VolumeLauncher.txt in the Unity Launcher to set targetApp.txt to the same folder as metaLauncher.

5) Double click RUN


NOTE: for best results on Windows, place the metaLauncher in the same directory as the Unity Launcher
